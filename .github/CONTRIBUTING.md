# CONTRIBUTING

We are using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as a continuous integration system.

For details, take a look at the following workflow configuration files:

- [`workflows/integrate.yaml`](workflows/integrate.yaml)

## Tests

We are using [`phpunit/phpunit`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) to drive the development.

Run

```sh
$ make tests
```

to run all the tests.

## Extra lazy?

```sh
$ make
```

to run tests!

## Help
